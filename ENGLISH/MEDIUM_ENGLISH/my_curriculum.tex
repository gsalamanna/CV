\section*{Current and past research Activities}
\setcounter{page}{1}
\subsection*{Current activities in ATLAS}
\subsubsection*{Top physics analysis} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Active in the study of $t\bar{t}$ events with high-$P_{T}$
leptons in the final state, selected by the {\it ATLAS} trigger.  
\item Co-author of first measurement of the $t\bar{t}$ pair production cross-section at the
LHC which $p-p$ collisions: in particular I have worked with the Nikhef group on the cross-section measurement in the semileptonic $t\bar{t}$ decays, with one
lepton, Missing Transverse Energy and high-$P_{T}$ jets in the final state, using a fit to the reconstructed hadronic top mass. The unbinned fit uses information on b-tagging to 
distinguish between signal and W+jets background; the result is almost 
insensitivite to W+jets rates higher with respect to expectations from simulation.  
\item coordinator of the sub-group of the ATLAS Top Working Group
that studies and optimizes the muon selections for Top analysis, both at the trigger level and offline. The group
includes about 10 people from different institutions, studying ways to select muons from $t \rightarrow W 
\rightarrow \mu + X$ decays, and reject secondary muons coming from quark decays, such as heavy flavours. 
The definition and optimization of variables like calorimeter and track-based isolation
and the final performance of the selections is documented in
Ref.~\ref{AtlNotes:1} and Ref.~\ref{AtlNotes:12}. 
\item main editor of the ATLAS note on Lepton selection and efficiency measurement used in the first cross-section measurement. The note (Ref.\ref{AtlNotes:12}) 
covers all the relevant information concerning electrons and muons and provides muon trigger and offline efficiency and momentum scale factors to re-scale the simulation to the signal acceptance on data. Tag-and-probe techniques using Z bosons are used, including an estimation of the muon fake rate directly from data.
\item In the past, {\it supervision} of work of PhD student A.~Doxiadis, Nikhef, in his study, to estimate the secondary lepton content in the $t\bar{t}$ sample using topological information (e.g. impact parameter) and isolation. 
\item co-author of the Top {\tt Event Data Model} adopted by the
ATLAS Top WG as a common framework for all Top analysis (Ref.~\ref{AtlNotes:3}).\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Muon reconstruction and analysis of performance}
\begin{itemize}
\item one of the developers of the {\tt MOORE} program for tracking in the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, together with a group of colleagues
 mainly from Nikhef. In particular, I have developed a second stage segment finding algorithm, 
which recovers hit segments in one ore more layers of the muon chambers, if they were not associated in the early stages of pattern recognition.
(improvement of momentum resolution for tracks in events with high hit multiplicity in the 
chambers, contributing to improve especially high-$P_{T}$ muon physics in ATLAS.) \\
\item first public measurement of the momentum scale offset and resolution of muons in the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer (MS) relative to the Inner Detector (ID),
on an inclusive muon sample from LHC $p-p$ collisions corresponding to 
$\approx 200~nb^{-1}$. {\it Supervising} the Nikhef student N.~Ruckstuhl, I studied the features of 
the momentum imbalance between the MS and ID measurements on combined muons as a function of kinematics and 
detector characteristics. Estimation of the contribution to the inclusive sample due
to a significant fraction of muons coming from pion and kaon decays in flight (bias in the resolution measurement from the MS-ID momentum imbalance distribution):  a template technique is used, which is documented fully in the ATLAS note \ref{AtlNotes:14}. 
The measurement has been published and presented at the ICHEP 2010 conference (Ref.~\ref{AtlNotes:8}). The results have also been used 
in the first ATLAS measurement of the $W \rightarrow \mu\nu$ production cross-section and observation of $Z \rightarrow \mu\mu$ production (Ref.~\ref{AtlNotes:11}). \\
\item in the past, responsible for the validation of the {\tt MOORE}  software chain on simulated samples, 
to monitor performances and stability of the various involved algorithms.
\item co-author of the ATLAS document on muon reconstruction performance
 on Monte Carlo events (Ref.~\ref{mio:2009cscmuon}).\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Level-1 Muon trigger timing calibration}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it commissioning} of the ATLAS Level-1 Muon trigger in the central part of the spectrometer ("Barrel"), provided by 
Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC), using cosmic ray muons.  I have developed a strategy to synchronize the various trigger units within 
the same Bunch Crossing interval (25 ns), by studying the jitters in the various RPC trigger elements with respect 
to an independent and precise time reference, given by an external trigger source. The trigger signals were compared with the presence of 
 offline muon tracks, in order to suppress fake triggers. Crucial to have a reliable Level-1 Muon trigger at 
the first stage of the on-line event selection and be able to perform any physics with muons in the final state at ATLAS. Synchronizatio of more than 70$\%$ of the sectors with cosmic rays (before LHC collisions). I have also developed the tools used in the ATLAS production for the Level-1 Muon barrel trigger
calibration with LHC collisions. 
\item results presented at the 2009 IEEE NSS-MIC Conference (Ref.~\ref{mio:2009ieee}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Past analysis activities in ATLAS}
\begin{itemize}
\item Research Associate at the University of Washington (UW), with a post-doctoral position for ATLAS (2007). 
Leading the development of specific trigger signatures in ATLAS to detect long lived particles decaying up to several meters away of the primary vertex in the ATLAS detector, expected in several non-Standard Model scenarios (e.g. Hidden Valley models). 
With my UW colleagues, I have studied the effect of new quantities from tracking and calorimetry to be used at the Level-2 trigger. Specific triggers are now run online in the ATLAS trigger menu for collisions. 
\item The results are documented in Ref.~\ref{mio:2009hv},~\ref{AtlNotes:4}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Past activities in CDF}
\subsubsection*{Flavour tagging and $B_{s}$ mixing analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Active in the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) experiment for 4 years (2002-2006). Master and PhD at University of Roma ``La Sapienza''. My research activities involved experimental HEP in the heavy flavour sector. 
\item Development of flavour tagging using K mesons produced in $B_{s}$ signal events, in the cascade decay of accompanying $b$ quark: for the first time non-null tagging performance achieved for Opposite-Side Kaon tagging at a hadron collider, where a very high track multiplicity is present (Ref.~\ref{CDFNotes:9}).
\item contributor in combination of CDF $b$-flavour taggers in Neural Network to enhance CDF sensitivity to $B_{s}^{0}$ mixing (Ref.~\ref{CDFNotes:8}). 
\item main contribution to the first measurement of the frequency, $\Delta M_{s}$: crucial constraint to New Physics in the flavour sector; attempted at LEP, SLC and Tevatron and uniquely possible at CDF (Ref.~\ref{Abulencia:2006obs}) thanks to excellent proper time resolution and enhanced flavour tagging capabilities.\\
\item In the summer 2006 work with the CDF group at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, directed by Prof.~M.~D.~Shapiro: alternative measurement of $\Delta M_{s}$ using the Fourier Tranform approach:  direct look at the space of frequencies, to search for a peak in the frequency distribution, as the Transform space of the time domain, instead of using standard {\it amplitude method}. 
\item calibration and monitoring of time resolution of CDF Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector, crucial tool for particle identification in CDF, used for flavour tagging of the $b$ quark in the $B_{s}^{0}$ meson by looking at tracks coming from the same fragmentation process (SSKT) or from decays of the accompanying $b$ quark (OSKT). Main tagging power of CDF for $B_{s}^{0}$  provided by Kaon tagging, thanks to excellent TOF performances  (Ref.~\ref{CDFNotes:10},  \ref{CDFNotes:12} and \ref{CDFNotes:18} ).
